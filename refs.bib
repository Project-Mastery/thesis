  abstract = {Modeling pedestrian dynamics and their implementation in a computer are challenging and important issues in the knowledge areas of transportation and computer simulation. The aim of this article is to provide a bibliographic outlook so that the reader may have quick access to the most relevant works related to this problem. We have used three main axes to organize the article's contents: pedestrian models, validation techniques, and multiscale approaches. The backbone of this work is the classification of existing pedestrian models; we have organized the works in the literature under five categories, according to the techniques used for implementing the operational level in each pedestrian model. Then the main existing validation methods, oriented to evaluate the behavioral quality of the simulation systems, are reviewed. Furthermore, we review the key issues that arise when facing multiscale pedestrian modeling, where we first focus on the behavioral scale (combinations of micro and macro pedestrian models) and second on the scale size (from individuals to crowds). The article begins by introducing the main characteristics of walking dynamics and its analysis tools and concludes with a discussion about the contributions that different knowledge fields can make in the near future to this exciting area.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that the motion of pedestrians can be described as if they would be subject to `social forces'. These `forces' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can be also applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: First, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion. Second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance to other pedestrians and borders. Third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion are nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.},

  abstract = {One of the most disastrous forms of collective human behaviour is the kind of crowd stampede induced by panic, often leading to fatalities as people are crushed or trampled. Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings; at other times, stampedes can arise during the rush for seats or seemingly without cause. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events. But systematic studies of panic behaviour and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics are rare. Here we use a model of pedestrian behaviour to investigate the mechanisms of (and preconditions for) panic and jamming by uncoordinated motion in crowds. Our simulations suggest practical ways to prevent dangerous crowd pressures. Moreover, we find an optimal strategy for escape from a smoke-filled room, involving a mixture of individualistic behaviour and collective 'herding' instinct.},

However, classifications, differences, and similarities of models are not clear at the conceptual level of navigation mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the superposition of scalar fields as an approach to microscopic crowd modelling and corresponding motion schemes. We use this background discussion to focus on the similarities and differences of models, and find that many models make use of similar mechanisms for the navigation of virtual agents. In some cases, the differences between models can be reduced to differences between discretisation schemes. The interpretation of scalar fields varies across models, but most of the time this variation does not have a large impact on simulation outcomes. The conceptual analysis of different models of pedestrian dynamics allows for a better understanding of their capabilities and limitations and may lead to better model development and validation.},

Another focus is the representation of pedestrians in the form of envelopes within the simulation. A software overview compares non-commercial programs for pedestrian simulation. It then analyzes the extent to which public geodata, such as OpenStreetMap data, can be used for corresponding simulations and which object types are suitable for pedestrian simulations. Building on this, the prototype implementation of the new, lightweight opensource software jCrowdSimulator, which simulates and visualizes pedestrians and crowds in urban environments, is presented. Finally, the results of the performance tests, which confirm a linear complexity with respect to the number of simulated people, are discussed.},

  abstract = {There is a wide range of simulation software used to investigate pedestrian dynamics. Most of these software are commercial or do not give an insight into the functionalities of their models. While this might be of little importance for many users, it is paramount for researchers to know exactly what the models are performing as this provides a better interpretation of the results. In this paper we introduce JuPedSim, the Jlich Pedestrian Simulator. JuPedSim is an extensible framework for simulating and analyzing pedestrians' motion at a microscopic level. It consists at the moment of three modules which are loosely coupled and can be used independently. The first module simulates the movement of pedestrians given a geometry and an initial configuration. Three-dimensional geometries are also supported. The start configuration includes the desired destinations, speeds, route choices and other demographic parameters. The second module visualizes the geometry and the trajectories. High resolution videos can also be recorded directly from the module interface. The third module analyses the results from the simulation or any other source, for instance experiments, and generates different type of plots such as densities, velocities and flows. This paper also introduces a new force-based model, which is designed for computing pedestrian trajectories in continuous space based on repulsive and attractive forces. In addition we describe the verification and validation process of the framework.},

abstract = {Understanding human behavior and predicting evacuation processes subsequently to an earthquake are critical aspects to provide valuable information to support disaster response activities. One possible and relevant aspect that characterizes human behavior in emergency situations is panic reactions, which can lead to dysfunctional and irrational responses by fugitives. Given the relevance of this component, this paper implements a panic behavior model in a large-scale agent-based model considering phenomenal parameters, such as seismic damage to the built environment, disruption of roads by earthquake-induced falling debris, and injuries of individuals. The proposed model is applied and tested in IdealCity, a virtual city simulation environment which resembles the geometry of the city of Turin, with about 900,000 inhabitants. The numerical simulations show that the inclusion of a panic behavior model increases the evacuation time despite the increased speed of agents during the evacuation process and this is probably caused by the fact that pedestrians tend to perform random actions before reaching their destination. Furthermore, existing human relationships between agents tend to convert the crowd from individual agents to group of agents that move together, and this behavior might affect the shelter saturation time of both shelters and hospitals as shown in the simulations analyzed in this paper.}

In this work, we use an agent-based formulation to model the collective human behavior in such crowd dynamics. We investigate the impact of panic behavior on crowd dynamics, as a specific form of collective behavior, by introducing a contagious panic parameter. The proposed model describes the intensity and spread of panic through the crowd. The corresponding panic parameter impacts each individual to represent a different variety of behaviors that can be associated with panic situations such as escaping danger, clustering, and pushing. Simulation results show contagious panic and pushing behavior, resulting in a more realistic crowd dynamics model.}, journal={Collective Dynamics},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications requires high computational efficiency, low-cost, and low-power solutions for various IoT devices. These include a wide range of microcontrollers that are used to collect, process, and transmit IoT data. ESP32 is a microcontroller with built-in wireless connectivity, suitable for various IoT applications. The ESP32 chip is gaining more popularity, both in academia and in the developer community, supported by a number of software libraries and programming languages. While low- and middle-level languages, such as C/C++ and Rust, are believed to be the most efficient, TinyGo and MicroPython are more developer-friendly low-complexity languages, suitable for beginners and allowing more rapid coding. This paper evaluates the efficiency of the available ESP32 programming languages, namely C/C++, MicroPython, Rust, and TinyGo, by comparing their execution performance. Several popular data and signal processing algorithms were implemented in these languages, and their execution times were compared: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Infinite Impulse Response (IIR), and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. The results show that the C/C++ implementations were fastest in most cases, closely followed by TinyGo and Rust, while MicroPython programs were many times slower than implementations in other programming languages. Therefore, the C/C++, TinyGo, and Rust languages are more suitable when execution and response time are the key factors, while Python can be used for less strict system requirements, enabling a faster and less complicated development process.},

  abstract = {This article presents an interdisciplinary study of physical and social psychological effects on crowd dynamics based on a series of bottleneck experiments. Bottlenecks are of particular interest for applications such as crowd management and design of emergency routes because they limit the performance of a facility. In addition to previous work on the dynamics within the bottleneck, this study focuses on the dynamics in front of the bottleneck, more specifically, at entrances. The experimental set-up simulates an entrance scenario to a concert consisting of an entrance gate (serving as bottleneck) and a corridor formed by barriers. The parameters examined are the corridor width, degree of motivation and priming of the social norm of queuing. The analysis is based on head trajectories and questionnaires. We show that the density of persons per square metre depends on motivation and also increases continuously with increasing corridor width, meaning that a density reduction can be achieved by a reduction of space. In comparison to other corridor widths observed, the narrowest corridor is rated as being fairer, more comfortable and as showing less unfair behaviour. Pushing behaviour is seen as ambivalent: it is rated as unfair and listed as a strategy for faster access.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian crowds often include social groups, i.e. pedestrians that walk together because of social relationships. They show characteristic configurations and influence the dynamics of the entire crowd. In order to investigate the impact of social groups on evacuations we performed an empirical study with pupils. Several evacuation runs with groups of different sizes and different interactions were performed. New group parameters are introduced which allow to describe the dynamics of the groups and the configuration of the group members quantitatively. The analysis shows a possible decrease of evacuation times for large groups due to self-ordering effects. Social groups can be approximated as ellipses that orientate along their direction of motion. Furthermore, explicitly cooperative behaviour among group members leads to a stronger aggregation of group members and an intermittent way of evacuation.},

  abstract = {As the world steadily recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, managing large gatherings becomes a critical concern for ensuring crowd safety. The crowd-crush disaster in Seoul in 2022 highlights the need for effective predictive crowd management techniques. In this study, an empirical analysis of this incident is conducted using data from various sources, and model-based simulations are created to replicate hazardous crowd conditions in high-risk areas. In the empirical analysis, mobile device data indicates a significant increase in population above normal levels in the disaster area just hours before the incident occurred. In the simulations, a hydrodynamic model is employed to simulate a bidirectional collision, which quantitatively demonstrates that the average density during the crush reached 7.57 ped/m2 (with a maximum of (9.95)ped/m2). Additionally, the average crowd pressure peaked at 1,063 N/m (with a maximum of 1,961 N/m), and the maximum velocity entropy was 10.99. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the primary causes of the disaster were the substantial population, bidirectional collision, and escalating panic. The results of controlled simulations under various management strategies are then presented. By implementing effective crowd management techniques, crowd safety can be enhanced through quantitative comparisons of these key indicators.},

While notions of `panic' and `stampede' have been discredited in contemporary psychology and disaster research as explanations for crowd crushes, Bethnal Green has been put forward as the exception that proves the rule. Alternative explanations for crushing disasters focus on mismanagement and physical factors, and lack a psychology. We analysed 85 witness statements from the Bethnal Green tragedy to develop a new psychological account of crowd disasters. Contrary to the established view of the Bethnal Green disaster as caused by widespread public overreaction to the sound of rockets, our analysis suggests that public perceptions were contextually calibrated to a situation of genuine threat; that only a small minority misperceived the sound; and that therefore, this cannot account for the surge behaviour in the majority. We develop a new model, in which crowd flight behaviour in response to threat is normatively structured rather than uncontrolled, and in which crowd density combines with both limited information on obstruction and normatively expected ingress behaviour to create a crushing disaster.},

  abstract = {The percentage of the passengers linked to airport activities often reflects not only the level of economic and touristic aspects of a city but also the development of the transport system. The airport area thus becomes a node in the transport system characterized by a high percentage of users, mostly passengers. Numerous studies state that incorporating the behaviour of groups of individuals, especially interactions with fellow travellers and people working within the same transit area, can significantly affect the performance and use of services in the terminals airport. The benefits and the criticalities induced by the movement of a large number of people within confined areas are linked to the definition of impacts that can be seen in terms of time spent in each processing unit, preference of discretionary activity and level of service (LOS) in the processing areas. On the basis of the airport passenger flow model that includes group dynamics, a case study was carried out regarding the movement of users inside the departures area of Fontanarossa-Catania airport. The evaluation of the social forces acting has been carried out through the definition of nodes and arcs with the aid of dedicated software. Some parameters are investigated in order to characterize the iterations between individuals or groups of individuals characterized by common parameters. Among these parameters both closeness and betweenness are particularly important, ie those parameters that show how much they measure the proximity of the various individuals that can limit the movement and the correlation between them The simulation of transit flows and iterations between passengers can be useful to investigate different scenarios inside a terminal such as the maintenance of certain areas that could limit the transit or even simulate evacuation scenarios in emergencies. For designers and airport operators, the model also provides a convenient way to investigate the effectiveness of the design space and services allocations, which can help improve the experience of passengers in Airports. In this sense, the presented work turns out to be fundamental for the definition of the areas and the flows and therefore can provide useful details for the subsequent implementation through micro-simulation tools of the pedestrian outflow.},

In particular, we focused on dyads, as the most frequent type of groups in the observed scenario. Results showed that in situation of irregular flows elderly pedestrians walked the 40\% slower than adults, due to locomotion skill decline. Dyads walked the 30\% slower than singles, due to the need to maintain spatial cohesion to communicate (proxemics). Results contributed to refine the parametric validation of the agent-based simulation system ELIAS38.},

  abstract = {Individuals with disabilities are essential members of heterogeneous crowds. However, empirical data on pedestrian flow, including individuals with disabilities, are limited. In this study, a controlled experiment was conducted to explore the dynamics of counterflow involving individuals without disabilities and with simulated disabilities. For safety reasons, some individuals without disabilities were recruited to simulate persons with mobility-related physical and sensory disabilities (namely pedestrians on crutches, seniors, wheelchair users and persons who are blind) by using auxiliary equipment. A total of 64 pedestrians participated in the experiment. After gaining their movement trajectories, crossing behaviors, spatial--temporal characteristics, fundamental diagrams and the congestion level are analyzed under different split flow ratios of walkers from two directions and densities. Results demonstrate that the average speed of pedestrians in the direction of pedestrian flow comprising more participants is higher than that in the other direction. Helping behavior positively impacts on the movement efficiency of heterogeneous crowds, while the proportion of individuals with simulated disabilities has a negative impact. The split flow ratio has little effect on the average specific flow when density is smaller than approximately 1.25~m-2. The average specific flow in balanced flow (i.e. the split flow ratio is 0.5) is slightly higher than that in unbalanced flow (i.e. the split flow ratio is not 0.5) when density is larger than approximately 1.25~m-2. Congestion level is relatively higher here than that in counterflow, including all individuals without disabilities, when density is low. These findings have implications for safer pedestrian facility design.},

abstract = {Pedestrian evacuation is one open question in a myriad of scientific disciplines and has attracted considerable attention during the past decades. Aim to issue, various research approaches, such as mathematical modeling and simulation, experimental studied and socio-psychology surveys, have been extensively employed. Different from previous frameworks, here a behavior-based cellular automaton model is proposed, which involves the environmental characteristics and neighbors’ behaviors. Given the certain range of degree of emergency, it is shown that enhancing the degree of emergency will shorten evacuation time yet decrease cooperation enthusiasm. The larger the degree of familiarity is, the shorter the evacuation time will be. In variance, larger the dependence of pedestrians will prolong the evacuation time. Besides, the novel model also produces some interesting self-organization phenomena, such as the collective behavior at the beginning of the evacuation and arch-like blocking at the end of the evacuation. When our model is finally applied to the evacuation scenario where a room has two symmetrically located exits, the symmetry breaking effect takes place. Our model may shed new light to the study of pedestrian dynamics in realistic world.}
